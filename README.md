## The Project

This project is a React Typescript app powered by Vite that uses Material UI for a component library and React Router for routing.

<br>

### Expectations

Going into this project we expect you to spend about 2-3 hours completing the objectives. Please try to timebox yourself to this amount of time.

However, there are no hard time cut offs here. Generally please do not exceed 4-5 hours on the project. If you want to spend some extra time adding any "bonus features", proceed at your own discretion.

If you find yourself stuck or struggling, try moving on to something else. If you're unable to complete everything within this timeframe, no worries! We're looking at more than just completing the objectives.

After you have submitted your work, we will review it internally first and then likely follow up with a technical interview and discuss your submisison. Be prepared to explain your solution, process, reasoning, and any challenges you may have faced.

<br>

### Guidelines

In this age, we have no shortage of tools available to us as engineers. For the sake of keeping things somewhat consistent for us, please try to stick to the packages and tools already installed and use native functionality otherwise.

Here are the packages you already have at your disposal:

- `@mui/material`
- `@mui/x-data-grid`
- `@tabler/icons-react`
- `react-router`

If you find yourself wanting to pull in another package, that's okay. Be prepared to give your reasoning on this decision.

You will see some "Bonus Objectives", focus on those after completing the main objectives.

Lastly, committing often helps us see your process.

<br>

### Objectives

- [ ] Ensure all items on the "Brief" page within the app are completed.
- [ ] Ensure CI passes.

<br>

## Submitting your work
